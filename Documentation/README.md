## Little introduction about Rock-Paper-Scissors(also known Roshambo)
**Roshambo is really simple and fun game, which you and your friend can play
if you argue about something minor.Also It's the _perfect_ game to kill 
time when you are bored.**

Here are the "brainkilling" rules:
>1. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper and paper beats rock.
>2. The time you have to unleash the _"superpower"_ is when the two players count off that order: "rock, paper, scissors 3, 2, 1..."
>3. ***Enjoy whole the time to pass the time!!!***
