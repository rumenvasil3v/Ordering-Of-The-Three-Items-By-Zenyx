# "Be cut off-Be broken-Be witty" Game
*The Main Goal Of The Project is about entertainment intentions.*

*It solves simple child's play.*

*People who haven't heard or want to try Rock-Paper-Scissors on computer program.*

*Also anyone can add something new if you would like.*

## Little introduction about Rock-Paper-Scissors(also known Roshambo)
**Roshambo is really simple and fun game, which you and your friend can play
if you argue about something minor.Also It's the _perfect_ game to kill 
time when you are bored.**

Here are the "brainkilling" rules:
>1. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper and paper beats rock.
>2. The time you have to unleash the _"superpower"_ is when the two players count off that order: "rock, paper, scissors 3, 2, 1..."
>3. ***Enjoy whole the time to pass the time!!!***

Winner is whose choice beats the choice of his opponent. If both players choose the same options(e.g. **rock**) the game outcome is "draw".

## Input and Output
The player choose between these 3 options:

  * ***rock*** or ***r*** option;
  * ***paper*** or ***p*** option;
  * ***scissors*** or ***p*** option;
  
The computer ***choose randomly*** an option.

## Solution
### Algorithm
The way. which I find a solution to this projcet is with If-else Statements(checks). I made a constant variables for the play and with them
i made checks what option to choose. Also did that for the computer, but the difference is that the option is chosen randomly. When they choose option the checks I made enter the game. It depends what is the option of the player and the computer,***e.g. player option rock (or r) and computer option scissors (or s). Player wins!***. If the player wants to play again, the user should enter **y[es] or n[o]**.

### Used technologies and Libraries
For the project I used **.NET Technology** and **.NET class libraries**, which with I make simple console application with class ***Program***.
